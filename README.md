# Cyber Analytics Platform and Examination System (CAPES)
![capes logo](http://capesstack.io/capes_logo.png)

**People ask from time-to-time what help is needed - documentation. If you see documentation that is wrong, be it grammar, incorrect guidance, or missing; please consider doing a PR correcting it. I will gladly give contributor status to anyone who does anything to make this project easier for people to get started.**

CAPES is an operational-focused service hub for segmented, self-hosted, and offline (if necessary) incident response, intelligence analysis, and hunt operations.

## Get Started
After the CAPES installation, you should be able to browse to `http://your_capes_system` (or `http://your_capes_IP` if you don't have DNS set up) get get to the CAPES landing page and start setting up services by following the [post installation steps](https://github.com/capesstack/capes/tree/master/docs#post-installation).

Although most of these services are fairly intuitive, I **strongly** recommend that you look at the [Build, Operate, Maintain](https://github.com/capesstack/capes/tree/master/docs#documentation) guides for these services before you get going too far. A few of the services launch a configuration pipeline that is obnoxious to restart if you don't complete it the first time (I'm looking at you TheHive and Gitea).

# Troubleshooting
Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/capesstack/capes/tree/master/docs#documentation) or feel free to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/capesstack/capes/issues).

You can run `$ capes_processes` to make sure all of your processes are running.
